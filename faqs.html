<h2>Some things I get asked about running this site...</h2>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>That's answered on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to run this site?</h3>
<p>Right now - basically nothing. The site is static, tiny and uses very little bandwidth. It would take incredible popularity (millions of hits a month) to break out of the free tiers of most providers, and after that an order of magnitude more to pass the resources on even $10 VPS offerings. So rest assured, the site will be around until the problem it's fixing goes away and it's made obselete.</p>
<h3>Are you going to run this forever?</h3>
<p>See above answer. But probably. That's the most honest answer. This site is tiny, piggy backs on existing hosting and doesn't cost me extra to run. </p>
<h3>Why did you make this site?</h3>
<p>Because I needed a site like this so I made one. I travel sometimes and have to deal with crappy wifi on aircraft, in hotels, via government sites and all sort of other places where things just don't work. I wanted a reliable and very low bandwidth site to connect to so I could almost certainly guarantee being able to log in to any captive portal, even over very slow connections. </p>
<h3>How do I suggest an improvement or let you know something is broken?</h3>
<p>Easiest to do that through the <a href="https://github.com/PuffinBlue/CaptivePortal/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.</p>
